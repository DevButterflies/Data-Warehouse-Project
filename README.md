# Auto Sales Reporting and Analysis Project

This project focuses on creating a data warehouse solution for **Auto Sales Reporting and Analysis** using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT), and Power BI. It provides insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and market trends through automated reports and visual analytics.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to design and implement a data warehouse that tracks auto sales data, enabling stakeholders to gain key insights and make informed business decisions. This includes:

1. **Data Integration**: Importing data from various sources (e.g., sales transactions, customer information, dealership performance).
2. **ETL Process**: Automated data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).
3. **Data Warehousing**: Structured storage in a star schema for efficient querying and reporting.
4. **Reporting & Analysis**: Building interactive dashboards and reports in Power BI to visualize auto sales trends, customer demographics, sales performance by region, and more.

## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**: Used for managing SQL scripts, stored procedures, and querying the data.
- **SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)**: For designing the data warehouse schema, including fact and dimension tables.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards and reports to visualize the sales data.

## Features

- **Sales Performance Reports**: Analyze sales over time, by region, dealership, and vehicle model.
- **Customer Demographics Analysis**: Segment customers based on age, income, and purchase history.
- **Dealership Performance Metrics**: Evaluate the performance of different dealerships, including total sales and average transaction value.
- **Market Trend Analysis**: Identify which vehicle models are gaining popularity and predict future sales trends.

## Installation & Setup
